# Scenario: Typo-squat

# Here the most common used DNS Name was was 'delhisldc.org'
# Now we look up typosquats of this domain name using dnstwist
# Now apache http logs were scanned to see if any automated service tried to connect to a typosquat or not


# DNS twist is also used by RecordedFuture as claimed on its Github

# To run --> upload 'apache_log_sample_edited.txt' in Google colab and Run
